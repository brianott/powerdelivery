	<h2>What is powerdelivery?</h2>
	<br />
	<p>An open-source toolkit for automating an IT asset release process using <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx" target="_blank">Windows PowerShell</a> that 
	enables higher quality and more frequent releases by following Continuous Delivery principles.</p>
	<p>Continuous Delivery is a term coined in the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">principles</a> of the 
	<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a> and the name of <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/" target="_blank">a book by Jez Humble of Thoughtworks and David Farley</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<h4 style="font-weight: normal">
			<i>
				&quot;Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and <b>continuous delivery</b> of valuable software.&quot;
			</i>
		</h4>
	</blockquote>
	<p>If a team's goal is to release to their customers in a production environment more often, they need a technology that 
	does a little more than a vanilla "automated build" tool. They also need this technology to be easy to use and not require 
	knowledge of object-oriented programming or expensive tools.</p>

	<h2>What does powerdelivery do?</h2>
	<br />
	<ul>
		<li><p>Lets you keep <a href="create.html#environment">environment settings</a> (server names, URLs, file system paths, database names, etc.) in simple YAML text files so the entire team has one place to go to know where stuff is and to change it.</p></li>
		<li><p>Lets you move the parameters you pass to any PowerShell command <a href="create.html#invoking_sections">into configuration files</a> so they can target different environments.</p></li>
		<li><p>Prevents builds that have not been <a href="use.html#environment_use">successfully deployed in your development environment</a> from making it to test (also known as staging or UAT) and further on to production.</p></li>
		<li><p>Includes many <a href="reference.html">included functions</a> that do the heavy lifting to deploy common assets on the Microsoft platform (web sites, databases, 
		cubes, and services are examples).</p></li>
		<li><p>Integrates with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Foundation_Server" target="_blank">Microsoft Team Foundation Server</a> to give you both detailed logging and a <a href="use.html#build_summary">comprehensive summary page</a> to see what happened when a build was deployed.</p></li>
	</ul>
