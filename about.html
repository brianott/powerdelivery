	<h1>What is powerdelivery?</h1>
	<p class="lead">A <b>free</b>, open-source toolkit for <b>automating deployment of software 
	features</b> using technologies that are <b>easier to work with by <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> operations personnel</b> 
	and enable <b>higher quality and more frequent releases</b> by following Continuous Delivery principles.</p>
	<p>Continuous Delivery is a term coined in the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">principles</a> of the 
	<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<h4 style="font-weight: normal">
			<i>
				&quot;Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and <b>continuous delivery</b> of valuable software.&quot;
			</i>
		</h4>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Continuous delivery is also the name of <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">a book by Jez Humble of Thoughtworks and David Farley</a>.</p>
	<h2>What does it do?</h2>
	<p>The philosophy behind Continuous Delivery is that teams need to release more often to their customers to 
	get feedback on their ideas before investing so deeply in them. This helps teams get to the truly valuable 
	features faster and also eliminates waste by identifying bad ideas early. To do this effectively requires 
	coaching in the approach to really succeed but typically boils down to these essential practices:
	<ol>
		<li>Use <a href="http://www.scrum.org">SCRUM</a> to manage the workload of your team.</li>
		<li>Define requirements using test scripts called <b>acceptance criteria</b>.</li>
		<li>Use automated testing to reduce <b>cycle time</b>, or the time between the conception of an idea when and it is available to users.</li>
		<li>Deploy into your development, test, and production environments with automation and <b>never let people modify your environment directly</b>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>powerdelivery supports all of these practices, but does the heavy lifting to enable primarily the last one.</p>
	<h2>What is required to use it?</h2>
	<p>Currently powerdelivery is designed to work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Foundation_Server" target="_blank">Microsoft Team Foundation Server</a> (TFS). 
	<abbr title="Team Foundation Server">TFS</abbr> 
	is an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tool that provides many great features that can be leveraged 
	by teams starting to do continuous delivery. However, powerdelivery only relies on the Team Build feature, 
	and should you choose to use a different project management tool, you can 
	still use it to get the same benefits for deployment automation.</p>
	<h2>How is it different?</h2>
	More than simply "yet another automated deployment technology", powerdelivery was designed specifically to 
	follow Continuous Delivery practices making your team more efficient by <b>eliminating the possibility of 
	releasing untested changes to production</b>. It is also designed to be <b>easier to work with than the existing 
	tools from Microsoft</b> for automated deployment by themselves. Microsoft recently acquired 
	<a href="http://www.incyclesoftware.com/inrelease/" target="_blank">Incycle Software's In Release</a> product which is meant to provide a similar deployment solution 
	as powerdelivery, however it requires understanding and use of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms734631(v=vs.90).aspx" target="_blank">Windows Workflow Foundation</a> 
	which has proven to be difficult for IT operations personnel to learn. It also encourages teams to think of the release to their environments 
	as separately designed processes.</p>
	<p>The core of powerdelivery is a simple framework 
	built on top of <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx" target="_blank">Windows PowerShell</a>. 
	Everything you can do with the massive array of existing PowerShell scripts and modules available from Microsoft and 
	on the web is available to you from powerdelivery. And once you write the deployment, you can target each of your 
	environments using the same script.</p>
	<h3>Why Windows PowerShell?</h3>
	<p><abbr title="Team Foundation Server">TFS</abbr> is great at watching your source code repository for 
	submissions and kicking off builds, but unless the features that come with the build out of the box are 
	enough for you, it requires significant customization to be suitable for a Continuous Delivery build 
	platform. I highly recommend you read Jez Humble's book he makes a much more detailed case about why <b>it 
	makes sense to author your builds in a scripting language</b>. This information will come in handy as you run 
	across folks who may be confused as to why you wouldn't just do it all within 
	<abbr title="Team Foundation Server">TFS</abbr> build itself and need to educate them.</p>
	<p>I'll summarize what's in the book to highlight the most important benefits. First, if your automated 
	build relies wholly on <abbr title="Team Foundation Server">TFS</abbr>, you can't run a build on your 
	computer that does everything that the server can. Second, if you want to really tap into automation you 
	will be modifying the build's behavior greatly and that requires recompilation of code in the case of 
	<abbr title="Microsoft Build">MSBuild</abbr>, or understanding the difficult Windows Workflow engine 
	that <abbr title="Team Foundation Server">TFS</abbr> leverages. Finally, to really automate as much 
	as possible you will be setting up and tearing down software and hardware infrastructure needed by 
	your environments as well as doing typical build activities (compiling, database changes) and most 
	IT operations personnel are more familiar with PowerShell than C# code or Windows Workflow foundation 
	as it is similar in use to bash shell scripting and batch files.</p>
	<p>Remember, <b>continuous delivery means continuously changing your release process</b> as well.</p>
	<h2>What is included?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A simple PowerShell framework for deploying your software into multiple environments.</li>
		<li>A "hook" into Microsoft Team Foundation Server that triggers your script when you "kickoff" a build.</li>
		<li>A mechanism for storing environment configuration settings in .yml or .csv files. For instance, your local computer, development, test, and production environment probably use a different database.</li>
		<li>PowerShell cmdlets (functions) and modules (libraries) that help with writing builds.</li>
		<li>PowerShell scripts that can be used to setup security appropriately between your automated build server and the computers it deploys to.</li>
